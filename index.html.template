      <p>Welcome to my library.</p>

      <p>I only have so much space on my shelves. Finished books get recorded here so that I can look back and remember them, long after they've gone on to a new home.</p>

      <p>Images are lazily loaded, but scrolling all the way to the bottom of the page will transfer approximately IMAGE_SIZEMB.</p>
