      <h1>My Library</h1>

      <p>Welcome to my library. I try to read a lot, but like many people who try to read a lot, I don't have room to keep everything, so I created this virtual library.</p>

      <p>When I finish a book, I add the cover to this list so that even when I get rid of the physical copy, I can still look back and remember it.</p>

      <h2>Technical Notes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>The HTML is generated from a template and the folder full of book covers.</li>
        <li>I tried to keep the images small, but I used lazy loading to ensure that images are only loaded when they come into the view port.
        <li>Warning for people on limited connections: If you scroll all the way to the bottom, you'll transfer approximately IMAGE_SIZEMB.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Scroll down to browse.</p>
